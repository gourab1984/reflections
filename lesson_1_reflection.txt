How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I compared the two files only in places where they are different and was able
	to easily identify the changes and mistakes in the new version compared to the old one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can compare my current code with that of a previous version, I can debug typos 
	and logical errors by comparing with the older version and also if my current 
	version is not up to the mark, I can always return to the previous version.
